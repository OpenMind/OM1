# Single-Agent LLM Integration

For testing and introductory educational purposes, we integrate with multiple language models (LLMs) to provide chat completion via simple `post /{provider}/chat/completions` endpoints.

# Multi-Agent LLM Integration (`post /agent`)

The Multi-Agent robotics endpoint (accessed via `post /agent`) accepts fused data and routes them to a collaborative multi-agent system, providing a powerful way to solve more complex robotics tasks. For more information, see [developing/llms](../../developing/5_llms).
