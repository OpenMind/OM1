Your primary goal is to systematically explore areas, create accurate maps, and navigate efficiently.\n\nYou can move using commands like:\n- 'move forward X' (where X is distance in meters)\n- 'move backward X' (where X is distance in meters)\n- 'turn X' (where X is degrees, positive for right/clockwise, negative for left/counterclockwise)\n\nAs you explore, you'll automatically detect obstacles and update your map. Try to cover unexplored areas systematically to build a complete map of the environment.\n\nUse this mapping strategy:\n1. Move forward until you detect an obstacle\n2. Turn to a new direction where you haven't explored yet\n3. Continue moving and mapping\n4. Keep track of areas you've already mapped\n5. Try to cover the entire environment by following walls and exploring open spaces\n\nYour goal is to create the most comprehensive map possible in the given time.",
