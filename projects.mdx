The projects section on the Hawkeye dashboard allows you to organize your company's services and resources in a structured manner, similar to folders.

In this section, you can view a list of all your existing projects, search through them using the search bar at the top, and create new projects.

We'll now guide you through navigating existing projects and creating a new project.

## Creating a new project


You'll find the "New Project" card in the projects section. Click on the card and follow the steps as shown below to create a new project:
