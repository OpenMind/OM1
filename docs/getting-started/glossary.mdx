## Action
A specific command, behavior, or task that the agent is instructed to perform in response to input from the user or the environment. Example: Moving, Speaking, Facial expressions.

## AI Agent
A system that can perceive its environment, process what it perceives, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals — either autonomously or with some human guidance.

## AI Runtime
The real-time system that keeps the AI agent running, thinking, and acting continuously.

## Cubly
Openmind’s official robotic hardware kit, designed to turn your AI agents into real, physical robots that can move, talk, and interact with the real world. 

## Cortex LLM
The core reasoning engine inside the OMI Runtime. It’s the Language Model responsible for decision-making, planning actions, and interpreting inputs from the agent’s senses (like vision, speech, or sensors).

## Cyclone DDS
A fast, reliable, and open-source Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware used for robot communication.

## DDS (Data Distribution Service)
A communication protocol designed for real-time, high-performance data sharing between distributed systems — like the different components inside a robot or AI agent.

## Frenchie
The personality module or personality pack for an Openmind AI agent, like Cubly. It defines how the agent behaves, speaks, reacts, and presents itself. 

## LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
a sensor technology that uses laser pulses to measure distances between the sensor and objects in the environment.

## ROS2
An open-source middleware framework designed to help developers build, manage, and run complex robotic systems. 

## Unitree G02
Unitree G02 is a humanoid robot platform (by Unitree Robotics), designed to showcase advanced robotics capabilities in movement, perception, interaction, and autonomy.

## Zenoh
a next-generation communication protocol designed to handle data in distributed systems — especially systems that combine Real-time communication, Data storage, querying, and computing.
