- Storage: 8GB
- Camera, speakers, microphone etc as robots sensors

### Software

- Python 3.10+
- uv 0.6.2
- [Openmind API key](https://portal.openmind.org/)

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `uv` for Python package manager
- `ffmpeg` for video processing
- `portaudio` for audio input and output

#### Package Manager

```bash Mac
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

``` bash Linux
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
``` 

#### UV (A Rust and Python package manager)

``` bash Mac
brew install uv
```

``` bash Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### PortAudio Library

This will let you speak to the LLM and it will generate voice outputs. On Mac and Linux, you need `portaudio`.

```bash Mac
brew install portaudio
```

```bash Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev
```

#### ffmpeg

FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.

```bash Mac
brew install ffmpeg
``` 

```bash Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
``` 

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository

Run the following commands to clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash clone repo
git clone https://github.com/OpenmindAGI/OM1.git
cd OM1
git submodule update --init
uv venv
```

2. Set the configuration variables

Locate the `config` folder and add your Openmind API key in `/config/spot.json`. If you do not already have one, you can obtain a free access key at https://portal.openmind.org/.  _Note:_ Using the placeholder key **openmind-free** will generate errors.

```bash set api key
# /config/spot.json
...
"api_key": "om1_live_e4252f1cf005af..."
...
```

Or create a `.env` file in the $HOME directory and add the following:

```bash
OM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Run the Spot Agent

Refer to the [Run OM1](/getting-started/run-om1) guide for more information.
