This guide offers an overview of the OM1 agent runtime system, helping developers understand its core components and workflows.

Inside, you’ll find detailed explanations of OM1’s CLI commands, recommended project structure, step-by-step instructions for adding new actions, and guidance on configuring your agent for different environments. Additionally, the guide includes practical development tips to streamline your workflow, along with a reference to optional environment variables that can be used to customize the runtime behavior of your agents.

Whether you're just getting started with OM1 or looking to optimize an existing project, this guide will equip you with the tools and best practices to develop, deploy, and maintain high-performance agents.

## CLI

The OpenMind OS provides a command-line interface (CLI) to manage agents and projects.

The main entry point is `src/run.py` which provides the following commands:

- `start`: Start an agent with a specified config

```bash Start an agent with a specified config
python src/run.py start [config_name] [--log-level] [--log-to-file]
```

- `config_name`: Name of the config file (without .json5 extension) in the config directory

- `--log-level`: Optional log level (default: INFO). Use `DEBUG` for detailed logs.
- `--log-to-file`: Optional flag to log to a file (default: False). If set, logs will be written to `logs/{config_name}.log`.

## Linting and Testing

Maintaining code quality and ensuring your agents work correctly is crucial when developing with OpenMind OS (OM1). This section covers recommended linting and testing practices to help you catch errors early, maintain code consistency, and validate agent behavior before deployment.

To check/format your code, run:
```bash
uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run black . && uv run isort .
```

To automatically run the lint check before committing, install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and execute `pre-commit install`. This ensures that pre-commit checks run before each commit. Additionally, you can manually trigger all checks by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.

### Unit Testing

To unit test the system, run:
```bash
uv run pytest --log-cli-level=DEBUG -s
```

Use type `hints` and `docstrings` for better code maintainability.
