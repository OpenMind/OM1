# Multi-Agent LLM Integration

The Multi Agent plugin seamlessly integrates OpenMind's OM1 capabilities within an agent architecture, allowing you to leverage our agent-based architecture using multiple LLMs for a rich experience.

## Overview

Multi Agent routes requests through OpenMind's collaborative multi-agent system, providing a powerful way to solve complex tasks. This approach combines the flexibility of multiple specialized agents working together to deliver enhanced capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple agents work together to solve complex problems
- **Robotic Team Integration**: Harness the power of specialized agents working together
- **Compatible Interface**: Uses the same patterns as standard LLM implementations

## Getting Started

To run the multi-agent system on OM1:

```bash
uv run src/run.py multiagent
```

## Technical Details

Under the hood, MultiLLM sends requests to the agent endpoint at `https://api.openmind.org/api/core/agent`. The system formats your inputs, facilitating communication between specialized agents like navigation and perception.

The request includes:
- System prompt context
- User inputs
- Available actions for the agents

## Use Cases

- **Robotics Applications**: Interface with physical systems through natural language
- **Complex Decision Making**: Combine multiple specialized agents for better reasoning
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Leverage different agents in a single workflow.
