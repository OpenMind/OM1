# Single-Agent LLM Integration (deprecated)

For testing and introductory educational purposes, we integrates with multiple language models (LLMs) to provide chat completion. The `post /{provider}/chat/completions` endpoint allows you to interact with different LLM providers to generate chat completions.

# Multi-Agent LLM Integration (`post /agent`)

The Multi Agent robotics cognition endpoint provides an agent-based architecture. The `post /agent` route sends fused data to a collaborative multi-agent system, providing a powerful way to solve more complex robotics tasks.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple agents work together to solve complex problems
- **Robotic Team Integration**: Harness the power of specialized agents working together
- **Compatible Interface**: Uses the same patterns as standard LLM implementations

## Getting Started

To try out the multi-agent system:

```bash
uv run src/run.py multiagent
```

## Technical Details

Under the hood, MultiLLM sends requests to the agent endpoint at `https://api.openmind.org/api/core/agent`. The system formats your inputs, facilitating communication between specialized agents like navigation and perception. The request includes:

- System prompt context
- User inputs
- Available actions for the agents

## Use Cases

- **Robotics Applications**: Interface with physical systems through natural language.
- **Complex Decision Making**: Combine multiple specialized agents for better reasoning.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Leverage different agents in a single workflow.
