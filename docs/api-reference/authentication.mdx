The OpenMind API uses API keys to authenticate requests. This guide explains how to obtain and use your API key securely.

## Obtaining an API Key

1. Sign up for an account at [OpenMind Platform](https://platform.openmind.ai)
2. Navigate to the API section in your dashboard
3. Generate a new API key for your project

## Using Your API Key

You can authenticate your API requests using one of two methods:

### 1. X-API-Key Header
The recommended method is to pass your API key using the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.openmind.ai/v1/chat \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

### 2. Bearer Token
Alternatively, you can use the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://api.openmind.ai/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

### WebSocket Connections

For WebSocket connections, include the API key as a query parameter:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.openmind.ai/v1/stream?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY');
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never share your API key or commit it to version control. Keep it confidential and secure at all times.
</Warning>

- Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration management systems
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Use different API keys for development and production environments
- Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repositories

<Note>
  If you believe your API key has been compromised, immediately rotate it in your dashboard and update all your applications.
