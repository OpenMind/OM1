## Requirements

### Hardware

- A laptop/PC
- A mobile phone
- UbTech Yanshee (mini humanoid robot)

### Software

- Yanshee mobile app
- OM1
- [OM1 API key](https://portal.openmind.org/)

### Installation

First, install the Yanshee mobile app on your phone. This will allow you to retrieve robot's IP address. Then, install OM1 on your laptop or PC, following the [standard instructions](../developing/1_get-started.mdx)

### Connecting to the Robot

- Switch on your bluetooth and location.
- Go to the Yanshee mobile application and click on the icon on the top right corner. 
- Check the serial number at the back of your robot and connect to the same robot. 
- Make sure you are connected to the same network as your system is connected to.
- Once the connection has been set up, check to make sure you are able to execute the functionalities available on the application.

### Retrieve the Robot's IP Address

Open the menu on the top left corner of the application. Go to Setup -> Robot information. Note down the IP address for future reference.

### Steps   

Set the OM1 API key and robot IP address in the config file (`config/ubtech_yanshee.json5`).

```bash
    #API key
    "api_key": "om1_live"

    #Robot IP address
    "config": {
        "robot_ip": "<your robot's ip address>"
      }
```

Then, run the the agent using `uv run src/run.py ubtech_yanshee`. You will now be able to make the robot take actions like walk forward, walk backward, turn right, turn left, bow, crouch and more via voice commands. You can also have a conversation with it and ask about its surroundings.
