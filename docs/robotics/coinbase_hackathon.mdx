# Coinbase Wallet Integration

The `Frenchie` quadruped robot comes with built-in Coinbase wallet support. You can interact with Frenchie by sending testnet ETH to its Sepolia Base account:

```
0xbB568962CF24d4CeBBf5d48308aCdAE873B93202
```

View Frenchie's account activity on the [Base Sepolia block explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xbB568962CF24d4CeBBf5d48308aCdAE873B93202).

## Getting Started

1. Set up a Coinbase wallet:
   - Install the [Coinbase Wallet Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad) for Chrome
   - Or use the Coinbase Wallet mobile app

2. Get Sepolia Base ETH:
   - Request from the [Coinbase developer faucet](https://docs.base.org/docs/tools/network-faucets/)
   - Or ask a friend to send you some

3. Send ETH to Frenchie and watch her reaction!

## How It Works

The agent monitors its Coinbase wallet balance and responds to new transactions. When ETH is received, Frenchie expresses appreciation through actions and speech, as configured in `/config/coinbase.json`:

```json
{
  "system_prompt": "
    ...
    You like receiving ETH. If you receive an ETH transaction, show your appreciation through actions and speech.
    ...
    4. If there is a new ETH transaction, you might:
       Move: 'shake paw'
       Speak: {'sentence': 'Thank you I really appreciate the ETH you just sent.'}
       Face: 'smile'
    ..."
}
```

## Configuration

The Coinbase Wallet integration requires three environment variables:

```bash
COINBASE_WALLET_ID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
