## RPLidar

These instructions are for an [RPLidar A1M8](https://bucket-download.slamtec.com/d1e428e7efbdcd65a8ea111061794fb8d4ccd3a0/LD108_SLAMTEC_rplidar_datasheet_A1M8_v3.0_en.pdf). This unit is used on the turtlebot4 and can be added to the Unitree Go2. 

## Setup

Run the `rptest.py` (located in `/system_hw_test/`) to determine the `sensor_mounting_angle` and the `angles_blanked`. These values depend on how you mounted the sensor and the radial position of any fixed obstructions, such as mounting brackets. You can figure out which value to use for your system by changing these values as neecded:

```py
"""
Robot and sensor configuration
"""
half_width_robot = 0.20  # the width of the robot is 40 cm
max_relevant_distance = 1.1  # meters
sensor_mounting_angle = 180.0  # corrects for how sensor is mounted
angles_blanked = [[-180.0, -160.0], [32.0, 46.6]] 
```

## Unitree RPLidar

Determine the serial port the sensor is using:

```bash
ls /dev/tty.*  
ls /dev/cu.*  
```

Then, run

```bash
uv run rptest.py --serial /dev/cu.usbserial-0001
```

## TurtleBot4

Connect to the `scan` Zenoh topic. Provide the robot's URID, such as `OM742d35Cc6634` as an argument:

```bash
uv run rptest.py --URID OM123435Cc1234
```

## Using the RPLidar A1M8 in OM1

Configure the `.json5` as needed: 

```python
"""
Robot and sensor configuration
"""
{
  "type": "RPLidar",
  "config": {
    "use_zenoh": true, # or false, if you are using serial to connect directly to the LIDAR
    "serial_port": "/dev/cu.usbserial-0001",
    "half_width_robot": 0.21, # the width of the robot is 40 cm
    "max_relevant_distance": 1.1, # meters
    "sensor_mounting_angle": 180.0, # corrects for how sensor is mounted relative to robot
    "angles_blanked": [[-180.0, -160.0], [32.0, 46.6]]
  }
}
```

## Architecture 

The system pre-computes 9 different paths, 4 to the left, one straight ahead, 4 to the right, and one to the back. For each of the Bezier curves, the code checks whether the path approaches any detected object to within `half_width_robot`. If not, the path is considered to be a valid choice and the motion system can execute that path. 

## Assumptions

The code assumes that any unpredictable barriers (e.g. humans crossing the path of the robot) will be avoided using separate code within the `action` driver, such as by issuing a "STOP" command when an object is detected in front of the robot.
