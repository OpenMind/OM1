## RPLidar

These instructions are for an SLAMTEC RPLIDAR A1M8. This unit is used on the TurtleBot4 and can be added to the Unitree Go2. 

## Architecture 

The collision avoidance and path checking code pre-computes 9 different paths, 4 to the left, one straight ahead, 4 to the right, and one to the back. For each of the 9 possible paths, the code checks whether the path approaches any detected object to within `half_width_robot`. If not, the path is considered to be a valid choice and the motion system can execute that path. 

## Assumptions

The code assumes that any unpredictable barriers (e.g. humans crossing the path of the robot) will be avoided using separate code within the `action` driver, such as by issuing a "STOP" command when an object is detected in front of the robot.  

## Setup

Run `rptest.py` (located in `system_hw_test`) to determine the `sensor_mounting_angle` and the `angles_blanked`. These values depend on how you mounted the sensor and the radial position of any fixed obstructions, such as mounting brackets. You can figure out which value to use for your system by changing these values as needed:

```py
"""
Robot and sensor configuration
"""
half_width_robot = 0.20  # the width of the robot is 40 cm
max_relevant_distance = 1.1  # meters
sensor_mounting_angle = 180.0  # corrects for how sensor is mounted
angles_blanked = [[-180.0, -160.0], [32.0, 46.6]] 
```

### How to determine the sensor_mounting_angle and the angles_blanked

- `sensor_mounting_angle`: The `sensor_mounting_angle` refers to the angle between the LIDAR sensor's scanning plane and the horizontal plane of your robot or platform. This parameter is crucial for accurately interpreting the sensor's data within your system's coordinate framework. The `sensor_mounting_angle` can be read physically from the LIDAR. Refer to the following image for guidance:  

![sensor_mounting_angle](/docs/assets/lidar_angle.png)  

- `angles_blanked`: The `angles_blanked` array can be used to prevent fixed obstructions in the field of view of the LIDAR from producing erroneous object avoidance messages.

## Unitree RPLidar

Determine the serial port the sensor is using:

```bash
ls /dev/tty.*  
ls /dev/cu.*  
```

Then, run

```bash
uv run rptest.py --serial /dev/cu.usbserial-0001
```

## TurtleBot4

By default, the TurtleBot4 is configured to use the RPLidar A1M8. You can verify this by running:

```bash
ls -l /dev/RPLIDAR
```

To see the raw LIDAR data, provide the robot's URID (such as `OM742d35Cc6634`) and run:

```bash
uv run rptest.py --URID OM123435Cc1234
```

Typically, this command would be executed on your laptop, connected to the TurtleBot4 via Zenoh.

## Using the RPLidar A1M8 in OM1

Configure the `.json5` as needed: 

```python
"""
Robot and sensor configuration
"""
{
  "type": "RPLidar",
  "config": {
    "use_zenoh": true, # or false, if you are using serial to connect directly to the LIDAR
    "serial_port": "/dev/cu.usbserial-0001",
    "half_width_robot": 0.21, # the width of the robot is 40 cm
    "max_relevant_distance": 1.1, # meters
    "sensor_mounting_angle": 180.0, # corrects for how sensor is mounted relative to robot
    "angles_blanked": [[-180.0, -160.0], [32.0, 46.6]]
  }
}
```
