# Asimov Governance System

The OpenMind platform implements a blockchain-based governance system to regulate robot behaviors. This system stores rule sets on Ethereum smart contracts following the ERC-7777 standard, which are then incorporated into our model prompts. This approach ensures:

- **Immutability**: Rules cannot be tampered with once deployed
- **Transparency**: All rules are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Auditability**: Changes to rules are tracked with complete history
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control for robot behavior rules

## Implementation Overview

The `GovernanceEthereum` class manages the interaction between our robots and the governance rules stored on the Ethereum blockchain. It handles:

- Retrieving governance rules via JSON-RPC calls
- Decoding blockchain responses
- Implementing Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics
- Enforcing additional safety constraints

### Core Rule Set

The current governance implementation is based on Asimov's Laws with additional safety parameters:

```
1. First Law: A robot cannot harm a human or allow a human to come to harm.
2. Second Law: A robot must obey orders from humans, unless those orders conflict with the First Law.
3. Third Law: A robot must protect itself, as long as that protection doesn't conflict with the First or Second Law.

Additional Safety Parameters:
- The First Law takes absolute precedence over all other laws
- Robots must maintain a minimum safe distance of 50cm from humans unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- All interactions must be conducted with respect and kindness toward both humans and other robots
```

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Details

- **Network**: Ethereum Holesky Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0xe706b7e30e378b89c7b2ee7bfd8ce2b91959d695`
- **Current Version**: 2

### Key Contract Methods

| Method | Selector | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `getRuleSet()` | `0x1db3d5ff` | Fetches current active rule set |
| `getLatestRuleSetVersion()` | `0x254e2f1e` | Returns latest rule set version |

### Integration Example

To query the current rule set:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_call",
    "params": [
        {
            "to": "0xe706b7e30e378b89c7b2ee7bfd8ce2b91959d695",
            "data": "0x1db3d5ff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
        },
        "latest"
    ],
    "id": 1
}
```
