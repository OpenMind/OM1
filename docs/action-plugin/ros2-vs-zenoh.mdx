## Difference Between ROS2 and Zenoh

| Feature                      | ROS 2                                                       | Zenoh                                                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                     | Full robotics framework (pub/sub, services, actions, params)| Middleware for data communication                         |
| Connection Layer            | DDS (Data Distribution Service)                             | Lightweight protocol (UDP, TCP, QUIC, etc.)               |
| Use Case                    | Complete robot software stack                               | Efficient, flexible data exchange                         |
| PC-to-Robot Communication   | Native but brittle across networks                          | Robust and NAT-friendly                                   |
| Real-Time Support           | DDS supports it, but can be heavy                           | Lightweight and real-time-friendly                        |
| Bandwidth Efficiency        | DDS can be verbose                                          | Highly optimized for low-bandwidth and lossy networks     |

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Design Philosophy

- ROS 2: Full robotic framework, includes message passing, services, parameters, lifecycle management.
- Zenoh: Focused on data movement — pub/sub, querying, storage. Built for flexible networking and performance.

### 2. PC ↔ Robot Communication

| Scenario                        | ROS 2                                                       | Zenoh                                                   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| LAN (same subnet)               | Works well with default DDS discovery                       | Works well (via multicast or peer config)                |
| Different subnets / NAT         | Fails by default unless tuned                               | Works out of the box, NAT/firewall friendly              |
| Wireless / Mobile Robot         | Performance issues possible                                 | Designed for low latency / jitter                        |
| Partial Connectivity            | Fragile                                                     | Zenoh can cache/store-forward                            |

### 3. Resource Usage

- ROS 2 + DDS: Can be heavy, not ideal for constrained devices.
- Zenoh: Lightweight, written in Rust/C++, supports embedded and microcontroller platforms.

### 4. Use Together?

Yes! Use [`zenoh-bridge-ros2`](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-bridge-ros2):

- Bridge ROS 2 topics to/from Zenoh
- Enable remote and reliable communication

## Recommendation: PC ↔ Robot Setup

| Condition                               | Suggestion                                |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Same subnet (LAN)                      | Use ROS 2 directly (Fast DDS, etc.)       |
| Remote, across networks or mobile      | Use Zenoh to bridge ROS 2                 |
| Low-bandwidth or unstable networks     | Prefer Zenoh for reliability              |

## Example Use Case

Scenario:  
Robot runs ROS 2 on Ubuntu, PC is remote or on a cloud/VPN network. Direct ROS 2 connection fails.

Use `zenoh-bridge-ros2`:
- Robot publishes `sensor_msgs/Image`
- Zenoh relays data to PC through NAT/firewall
